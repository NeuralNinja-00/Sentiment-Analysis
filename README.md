# Sentiment-Analysis
The Sentiment Analysis Project is focused on developing an advanced system to automatically analyze and classify the sentiment expressed in textual data. By leveraging state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) techniques, machine learning algorithms, and deep learning models, the project aims to accurately identify whether a piece of text is positive or negative.

The project involves Sentitments from tweets about their experience with a specific Airlines. The raw textual data will be preprocessed to clean and standardize it, followed by feature extraction to represent the underlying sentiment. Machine learning and deep learning models will be developed and trained on this data to classify the sentiment effectively.
